# CORE DNS-Protocol

A decentralized naming service (DNS) protocol on the CORE blockchain, inspired by Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This project lets users register human-readable `.core` domains, map them to on-chain and off-chain resources, and manage ownership through smart contracts.

👉 Live App: [CoreDns](https://coredns.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Features

- **Domain Registry**: Store and manage ownership, registration, and expiration of `.core` domains.
- **Resolver**: Associate domains with detailed records (wallet address, IPFS hash, email, social media link).
- **Registrar**: Handle domain registration and renewal with a configurable fee and period.
- **Front-end dApp**: Next.js application for users to connect wallets, register domains, view public registry, and manage personal domains.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: EVM-compatible CORE chain (testnet RPC at `https://rpc.test2.btcs.network`).
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.x, Hardhat, Ethers.js.
- **Front-end**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Ethers.js.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Hardhat CLI](https://hardhat.org/)
- A CORE testnet wallet and a funded account private key

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coredao-org/dapp-tutorial.git
cd dapp-tutorial/16-dns-protocol
```

### 2. Install dependencies (root)

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the root folder with:

```ini
PRIVATE_KEY=your_core_testnet_private_key
RPC_URL=https://rpc.test2.btcs.network
```

### 4. Compile & Deploy Contracts

Compile contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Deploy to CORE testnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network core
```

> _Note the deployed addresses printed in console._

### 5. Configure Front-end

1.  Navigate to the `Frontend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd Frontend
    ```
2.  Install front-end dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Open the config.json file located in the constants folder within the Frontend directory:

    ```bash
    Frontend/constants/config.json
    ```

    Update the contract addresses as follows:

         Contract One Address: Replace with the deployed address of the ENS Registry contract.
         Contract Two Address: Replace with the deployed address of the Registrar contract.
         Ensure that the addresses are correctly formatted as strings. For example:

    ```ini
     {
     "contractOneAddress": "0xYourENSRegistryAddress",
     "contractTwoAddress": "0xYourRegistrarAddress"
     }

    ```

### 6. Run the Front-end

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the DNS dApp.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage Overview

1. **Public Registry Page**: View all registered `.core` domains and their owners.
2. **Search**: Filter domains by name to see owner details.
3. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask or other EVM wallet to connect.
4. **Register Domain**: Type your desired name (without `.core`), the suffix is added automatically. If available, confirm transaction. If taken, an error displays the current owner.
5. **My Domains**: In your dashboard, view domains owned by your connected wallet.
6. **Resolver Management**: (Optional) Update domain records (wallet, IPFS, email, social) via the resolver interface.

## 📝 Testing

> _The provided tests cover the sample Lock contract._

Run Hardhat tests:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

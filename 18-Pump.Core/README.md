## 🚀 Deploy to Core Testnet

To deploy your contracts on **Core Testnet**, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up `.env`

Make sure your `.env` file in the root directory includes:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
CORE_TESTNET_RPC=https://rpc.test2.btcs.network
```

### 2. Update Hardhat Config

Ensure your `hardhat.config.js` includes the Core Testnet configuration:

```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.19",
  networks: {
    coreTestnet: {
      url: process.env.CORE_TESTNET_RPC,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
      chainId: 1115,
    },
  },
};
```

### 3. Compile & Deploy

Compile contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Deploy:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network coreTestnet
```

> 🧠 After deploying, copy the deployed contract addresses and paste them into your frontend’s environment config or contract interaction hooks.

## 🛠️ Creator Dashboard Starter

The project includes a placeholder structure where developers can build their own **Creator Dashboard** to manage token performance, community, and liquidity.

📍 Located in the frontend:

```bash
Frontend/app/dashboard
```

💡 Ideas to Extend:
